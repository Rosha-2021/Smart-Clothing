      <h2>What is smart clothing?</h2>

      <p>Smart clothing is clothing that has technology embedded in it. Smart clothes also known as smart garments, and smart textiles are clothing items that use technology to increase their use beyond what the clothing is traditionally used for. When people think about smart clothing they think of fitbits, apple watches, and technology worn by those who need their health monitored; however smart clothing has expanded beyond just these devices. With the use of nanotechnology many companies are working to create smart garments. These smart clothing can sense and respond to temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and more. Although not many companies are looking to make smart clothing because of its low demand as well as its cost. Smart clothing can go up to 4 times the usual price because of the technology that is used in it. This makes it harder for providers to sell to the average consumer. However, with the rise of technology, smart clothing is sure to be the next best thing on the market.</p>
