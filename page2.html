      <h2 class="spacing">Pros:</h2>

      <ol>
        <h4>Improving Everyday Life:</h4>
        <li>One of the many advantages that smart clothing has is that it provides people with the ability to monitor both their health and fitness levels. This can be great for people who exercise on a daily basis and need something to track their progress and vitals. This is also great for people with health issues and conditions who need constant monitoring.</li>

        <h4>Improving the Medical Field:</h4>
        <li>With the rise of smart clothing, the medical field is due for a big change, whether that is how patients are treated, patient comfort and more. Smart clothing allows for patients to be monitored in the comfort of their own homes, instead of being joined to machines in hospitals. Smart clothing also saves money on both ends; pretty much eliminating the need for many big and expensive medical equipment, as well as cutting costs for patients so they do not have to travel to the doctor's office.</li>

        <h4>Convenient:</h4>
        <li>The best part about smart textiles is that they are hands free and portable, eliminating the need to take devices such as phones out. These clothing items also look pretty much like everyday clothing items so they are basically hidden in plain sight. Smart clothing can also be made with pretty much any fabric making it so that it is both comfortable and fashionable.</li>

      </ol>

      <h2 class="spacing">Cons:</h2>

      <ol>
        <h4>Expensive:</h4>
        <li>Smart clothing can have many advantages because of the technology embedded in it, however this is also what can make it quite expensive. Because of this not a lot of companies are willing to invest and make smart clothing. The reason for this being that they know that the average person will not buy smart textiles because of its high price range.</li>

        <h4>Short Battery Life:</h4>
        <li>Another disadvantage of smart clothing is that it can have a short battery life. Many existing smart clothing require the wearer to charge it manually. This can be annoying for many people to have to remember to charge your clothing. However many manufacturers of smart wearables are looking into wireless charging options, eliminating the need to actually remove the garment and charge it manually.</li>

        <h4>Measure Data Inaccurately:</h4>
        <li>Lastly, the scariest disadvantage that can come with smart clothing is that it may measure data inaccurately. This is especially dangerous when it comes to medical wearables which collect data, and then send it to medical staff. This can be problematic for patients with heart conditions, since most smart clothing made for people with heart problems measures heart rate, and blood pressure.</li>
