      <p>The main goal in professional sports is to improve athletic performance maximising their skills. Smart textiles can help improve and monitor performance for both the average person and professional athletes. The data provided by these clothes can provide input on current performances so that athletes can use it to better their future performances. Currently wearable garments gather data such as heart rate, GPS (distance covered or location), acceleration and more. Under armour has come out with running shoes that can help improve runners performance. They can measure distance, pace, and acceleration. These shoes have built in chips in their soles that collect and provide data via an app. Smart clothing can also help coaches and trainers precisely understand what players are capable of as well as how they can improve. Furthermore smart clothing can help athletes avoid injuries by sensing muscle movement.</p>

      <h3>Health:</h3>

      <p>Sensors in smart textiles can measure body functions such as heart rate, breathing, lung capacity, muscle movement and more. This information can be quite useful when it comes to monitoring the health of athletes. A company called Ambiotex has come up with smart shirts meant for athletes. These compression-style shirts use sensors to record the vitals and data of athletes. This shirt can record heart rate viability, aerobic threshold, fitness levels, and stress levels. Smart clothing has a potential to reduce and to eliminate many injuries as well as reduce the risk of over exercising. In addition to this if smart clothing develops far enough it can gather data that can predict injuries before they even happen.</p>

      <h3>Improving Performance:</h3>

      <p>Sensors in smart clothing are one of the most important things. They can measure anything from posture, body movement and more. Measuring this data can greatly impact the performance of athletes and their technique. An example of what is on the market are smart yoga pants from Wearable X. These smart leggings have vibrating motors woven into the fabric that gently vibrate and give the wearer instruction on how to move in the correct direction/position.</p>

      <h3>Overall:</h3>
      <p>Overall with the rise of smart clothing in the sporting world athletes now have a much higher chance of improving their performance and technique. Not only are smart textiles innovative but they are also very comfortable and reliable. Whether it is improving players skills/ fitness levels, avoiding injury and monitoring their health, smart clothing is the next big thing in sports.</p>
